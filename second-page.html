            Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich (Raman Pratasevich) was
            arrested in Minsk on May 23. The former editor-in-chief of the
            prominent Belarusian opposition outlet Nexta was flying from Athens
            to Vilnius when the Belarusian authorities diverted his Ryanair
            flight to Minsk due to an alleged bomb scare (Belarus’s transport
            authority later claimed that it had received a false threat from
            Hamas). Roman Protasevich’s whereabouts were unknown until late in
            the day on May 24, when Belarusian police officials confirmed that
            he was in custody in a pre-trial detention center in Minsk.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            Not long afterward, a pro-government Telegram channel released the
            first footage of Protasevich since his arrest — a video in which he
            asserts that he was “cooperating with the investigation” and had
            confessed to organizing riots in Minsk (a felony punishable by up to
            15 years in prison). Earlier in the day, Meduza special
            correspondent Alexandra Sivtsova interviewed the jailed journalist’s
            mother, Natalya Protasevich, who spoke about her son’s arrest, his
            journalistic work, and his dreams for the future of Belarus.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            Asked how she’s feeling, Natalya Protasevich says she’s hardly
            thinking about herself right now. “[I had] a sleepless night, my
            heart aches. But now I’ve forgotten about my own well-being. All my
            thoughts are only about my son.”
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            The Belarusian authorities removed her 26-year-old son, Roman
            Protasevich, from a Ryanair flight that was diverted to Minsk on May
            23. They arrested him in the Minsk National Airport. At the time of
            Natalya’s interview with Meduza, Roman’s whereabouts were unknown —
            “even to the lawyers.”
